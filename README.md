-I plan on using Canvas to design this game.
-also going to be using a pixle designer to come up wiht the desifgns of the cystals monsters and player.

##approach taken 
I really want to come at this with a goal of setting up on Canvas with a fulling working game map and enemys that will attack you
-the game map would wwork by when you walk to the 'door' you would walk throught to the next room
-the enemys would have different ways they work
-include a heart system that when you are hit you lose a heart
-the goal of the game it to collect the 4 crystal that are in the 4 corners of the map and bring the to the top of the map to win the game
